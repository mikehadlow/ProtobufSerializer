# ProtobufSerializer

This is a simple example of how to use `Google.Protobuf` without code generation.

It demonstrates a simple protobuf serializer/deserializer that can create and receive ad-hoc messages.

This is .NET 6 solution. It should build and run directly from Visual Studio 2022.

`Program.cs` runs a series of tests of `Serializer.cs` and includes comments on how to use it. Start there.
